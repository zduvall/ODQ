  description:
    'A 10-item self-administered test used to identify childhood experiences of abuse and neglect. Research behind the ACE questionnaire found that childhood trauma and stress early in life can impoair social, emotional, and cognitive development, and correlate with a higher liklihood of developing general health problems in adulthood.',
  target: 'trauma - childhood',
  link: 'https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/index.html',
  instructions:
    'This Questionnaire will be asking you some questions about events that happened during your childhood; specifically the first 18 years of your life. The information you provide by answering these questions will allow us to better understand problems that may have occurred early in your life and allow us to explore how those problems may be impacting the challenges you are experiencing today. This can be very helpful in the success of your treatment.',
  score:
    'For each question a "yes" answer is worth 1 point and a "no" answer is worth 0 points. At the end, points for all questions are added up for a maximum of 10 points.',
  interpretation:
    'The higher the ACE Score, the greater the likelihood that a person will develop one or more of various physical, social, mental, and behavioral problems',
